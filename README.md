TOP 10 Interview Tips For Freshers To Get A Dream Job

A recent survey of more than 500 human resources and business professionals found that half of all college graduates do not exhibit professionalism at work.
Consistently topping the list of problem areas is inappropriate appearance and poor communication skills.

Here are the top tips to crack any interview:

Before the interview do the following:

1. Research the company: Learn the company's history, mission, and recent activities. Be sure to look at the company's web site and on-line press room.

2. Clean up your digital image: Remove photos, links, and text that might be viewed as inappropriate from all social media web sites and the web sites of your friends.

3. Listen to your voice mail message: Make sure your outgoing message is clear, concise and not off-putting to potential employers. That means no: "Hey, it's Jes, you know what to do."

4. Customize your resume: Your resume should highlight the skills most relevant to the career you're pursuing. That means including all pertinent job experience such as internships in your chosen profession.

5. Get ahead of the curve: Invest in a personal business card that can be printed inexpensively by one of the many e-retailers or visit your local stationery store. Cards should be kept simple with just your name and contact information.

6. Practice, practice, practice: Rehearse answers to standard interview questions like: "what are your weaknesses?" "what are your strengths?" "where do you hope to be in five years?"

On the day of interview:

1. Arrive early: Busy people do not like to be kept waiting; and it shows disrespect. Arrive five minutes early but don't rush; you want to be calm and poised for the interview.

2. Dress like you mean business: Wear neutral colors and, if in doubt, err on the side of dressing "too professional." Women should wear some make-up (it makes you look more professional) and keep jewelry simple. Men should wear suits and well-polished shoes.

3. Turn your phone off: All mobile devices should be turned off completely. Nothing says "this interview is unimportant to me" more than taking a call or looking at a text during a meeting.

4. Connect with people: From the receptionist to the last person you meet, make direct eye contact, 40-60 percent of the time, in-between the eyes and offer a firm handshake to the interviewer when arriving and departing.

7 Deadly Interview Mistakes Which Should be Avoided

Having trouble getting job offers? You might be committing one of these seven deadly interview mistakes:

No: 1. Being late: 

While occasional lateness may be excused in other situations, it's often a deal-breaker in a job interview. Hiring managers assume that you're on your best behavior while interviewing, so if you aren't on time for the interview, they'll assume you'll be unreliable if they hire you. Always allow more time than you'll need to travel so that you have a buffer in case something goes wrong.

No: 2. Badmouthing a former employer: 

As tempting as it might be to explain that you left your last job because your boss was crazy or that your previous company was mismanaged and corrupt, sharing these feelings will reflect badly on you. Rightly or wrongly, the interviewing convention is that you don't badmouth a previous employer. Hiring managers are looking for evidence that you know what is and isn't appropriate to say in business situations.

No: 3. Not being prepared with examples that illustrate why you'd excel at the job: 

If you claim that you excel at strategizing or that you're an innovative genius, but then aren't able to give specific examples of how you've used these skills, interviewers aren't going to give much credence to your claims. Make sure to come to the interview prepared with specific examples from your past that show how you've turned your skills into real accomplishments at work.

No: 4. Telling an off-color joke: 

Interviewers are scrutinizing you for evidence of what kind of judgment you have. No matter how friendly your interviewer might seem, inappropriate jokes or off-color language have no place in a job interview. You'll call your judgment into question, and will make your interviewer wonder what you'll be like when your guard is down after you have the job.

No: 5. Not asking any questions: 

You might be spending eight hours a day in this job, at this company, with this manager. Are you sure there's nothing you're wondering about? Interviewers want to know that you're interested in the details of the job, the department in which you'll be working, the supervisor's management style, and the culture of the organization. Otherwise, you're signaling that you're either not that interested or that you just haven't thought much about it. So come prepared with thoughtful, intelligent questions about the work you'd be doing.

No: 6. Sounding bitter: 

Job-searching is tough, and it's easy to feel discouraged. But if you sound even the tiniest bit bitter or negative about your job search or a previous employer, you'll turn off potential employers and almost guarantee that you won't get offers. No one wants to hire someone who seems angry or resentful.

No: 7. Not being likeable: 

Interviewers are human and want to work with pleasant people. If you're unfriendly, arrogant, or rude, it won't matter how qualified you are; interviewers won't want to hire you. So be friendly and open, and show genuine interest in the people with whom you're talking. Don't feel you have to hide your personality, or be so formal that you become stiff or impersonal
